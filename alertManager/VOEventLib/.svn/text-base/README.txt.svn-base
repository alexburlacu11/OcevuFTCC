Copyright Roy Williams
Thanks to Dave Kuhlman for the GenerateDS code binding package.

There are two parts to the software, one generated automatically from the
VOEvent schema (VOEvent.py), another (Vutil) built to provide more useful 
programming paradigms plus some sugar methods.

Instructions
------------
-- Put the VOEventLib/lib directory in your PYTHONPATH
-- Go to the VOEventLib/lib/examples directory and try some of the programs
    format_as_html.py reads an event, and makes simple HTML from it
    modify.py reads an event, modifies it, and outputs the new event
-- Read the documentation of the base code in VOEventLib/lib/doc/index.html
-- Sample events are in the events directory
-- Read the VOEvent specification (2.0 draft) in VOEventLib/lib/doc/VOEvent.html
